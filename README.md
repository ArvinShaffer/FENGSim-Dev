#### About the FENGSim project

The FENGSim project is an open source project for the digital twin including CAD, CAE, CAM and CAI. Normally it is difficult and impossible to develop a digital twin system like Siemens TeamCenter, Dassault 3D Experience, Ansys WorkBench without many people and a lot of money, but we prove that we could do it by using open source software, and it is easy and good enough for the industry. If you want to have your own digital twin software, you could use FENGSim and find how to develop it in the details  and all the codes in our github project. 

**About Digital Twin**

For our understanding, there are three important things about the digital twin. 

- The manufacturers could not finish all the testings to confirm the full capability of the products especially for the complex engineering like aircrafts because of the cost and time. There should be an optimization through the whole product life. 
- The manufacturers always like to concentrate on the manufacturing and they don't want to do the MRO by themselves. The users or the third party will do MRO, but they will follow the instructions from the manufactures. Since the manufacturers will not follow the real situations of all the products in details, the instructions from them will be very conservative. So the MRO is a very big cost for users. The MRO will affect the capability of the products greatly.
- The manufacturing is a very complex physical procedure. After the manufacturing, the real product will be different with the design and this will also affect the capability of the products greatly. We should use the real model which consider the factors from the manufacturing with the virtual model together.   

#### Airfoil

We will use an example about airfoil to introduce how to build a digital twin system by using FENGSim.
