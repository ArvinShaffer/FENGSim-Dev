#### About the FENGSim project

The FENGSim project is an open source project for digital twin. Normally it is difficult and impossible to develop a digital twin system like Siemens TeamCenter, Dassault 3D Experience, Ansys WorkBench. But we prove that we could do it by using open source software, and it is easy and good enough for the industry. If you want to have your own digital twin software, you could join the FENGSim project. 

**About Digital Twin**

For our understanding, there are three important things about digital twin. 

- The manufacturers could not finish all the tests to confirm the full capability of the products especially for the complex system engineering like aircrafts because of the cost and time. There should be an optimization through the whole product life. 
- The manufacturers would like to concentrate on their design and production and they don't want to do the MRO by themselves. The users or the third party will do the MRO, but they will follow the instructions from the manufactures. Since the manufacturers can not follow the situations of the products, the instructions from them will be very conservative. So the MRO is a big cost for users and it will affect the capability of the products greatly.
- The manufacturing is a very complex physical procedure. After the manufacturing, the real product will be different with the design and this will also affect the capability of the products greatly. We need to improve the manufacturing technologies and evaluate the capability of the products considering the affects from the manufacturing.    

#### Airfoil

We will use an example about airfoil to introduce the concept about the digital twin by using FENGSim.
